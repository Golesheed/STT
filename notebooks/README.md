## ✅ Description
This is a STT which was made as an assignment for my Programming course from MSc Voice Technology at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen/Campus Fryslân.

The data is my 105 English recordings in [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en).


## What did I do?
How I first did it was just like the notebook but then realized the link will be expired after some time so I just downloaded my data and uploaded it here so I  can train my STT easier.
